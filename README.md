# Learn Korean using your browser's built in speech synthesizer

Modern browser's include powerful support for speech synthesis and recognition.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis.

This game takes advantage of that to provide a patient partner for learning Korean.

In the first version, random syllables are generated, and it's your job to figure out
which one is getting spoken.

Warning: the quality of the synthesized speech can be variable. If you're using Chrome,
you may want to select the "Google" voice, which seems qualitatively better than the
others available.
